# Elampki
At Elampki, my work has been instrumental in driving technological innovation and operational efficiency through the development of internal-use web applications, as well as the implementation and maintenance of infrastructure and monitoring systems.

**Task Scheduling Web Application**: I developed a web application using TypeScript, React, and Node.js, which integrated with the shop's API and was a game-changer for our employees. It enabled them to avoid conflict of interests, by automatically routing customers and their orders to individual employees, taking into account repeat clients. Its introduction has heavily streamlined day-to-day operations.

**Partnered Customer Web Application**: I developed a specialized web flow that facilitated a unique order process and communication channel for our partnered customers. It enhanced our business relationships by offering a tailored, seamless experience, reinforcing our commitment to customer satisfaction.

**Landing Pages Development**: I designed and developed multiple mission-critical landing pages that cater to over 5,000 customers daily. By focusing on user experiences and continuously improving them through A/B testing and monitoring tools like CrazyEgg, these pages had significantly contributed to enhancing customer engagement and conversion rates.

**Integration Software for Real-Time Stock Updates**: I created an integration process and software that aggregated product availability data from multiple suppliers and updated our warehouse system in real-time. This, given the proximity to certain warehouses (same-day delivery) allowed for displaying some foreign stock as our own and ensured that quantities are always up-to-date.

**High Availability Kubernetes Cluster**: I set up and maintained a high-availability Kubernetes cluster that hosted all of the company's services and web applications, using a mixture of Ansible and Terraform.

**CI/CD Processes Implementation**: I designed and implemented CI/CD processes using GitLab CI/CD. This automated the building, testing, and deployment of projects, significantly accelerating development cycles and ensuring high-quality releases.

**Legacy Service Monitoring System Redesign**: I undertook the redesign of a legacy service monitoring system and successfully integrated it into all company-hosted services. This enhanced monitoring framework has improved our operational visibility and proactive issue resolution, contributing to overall service reliability.
