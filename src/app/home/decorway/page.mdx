At Decorway, I've played a pivotal role in revolutionizing our manufacturing and digital presence through a series of impactful projects. My contributions have spanned the development, deployment, and optimization of both our back-end services and our online visibility.

**Manufacturing Efficiency Enhancement**: I developed a back-end service using Node.js and JavaScript, which integrated to our nesting software. This allowed to optimize our CNC production planning based on client orders, resulting in a remarkable 30% increase in manufacturing throughput, as planning would not have to be done manually anymore.

**Website Development and SEO Optimization**: I designed and developed the company's static website using GatsbyJS and Node.js. My focus on applying best SEO practices ensured an improved company image and enhanced online visibility. This initiative has been instrumental in establishing a strong digital footprint and attracting a wider audience to our brand.

**Deployment and Architecture**: I managed the deployments of all services on local, Linux-based machines, leveraging tools like GitLab and Ansible. This responsibility ensured our digital infrastructure was robust and reliable, aligning with our growth objectives.

**Digital Transformation**: I have been at the forefront of improving technological processes within the company. By digitalizing information and developing Node.js and .NET scripts for intra-company task automation, I significantly enhanced operational efficiency. These improvements have streamlined workflows, reduced manual errors, and accelerated the execution of tasks across various departments.
