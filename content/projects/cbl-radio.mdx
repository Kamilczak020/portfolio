At CBL Radio, I was contracted to develop a new website, aimed at transforming the station's digital presence and enhancing listener engagement, by allowing the DJ radio users to reserve time slots for music sets, managed by the radio staff.

**Website Development and Brand Representation:** My primary focus was to design and develop a website that truly encapsulated the essence of CBL Radio. The website served as a digital hub for the radio, showcasing its programs, DJs, and special events, thereby strengthening the station's online identity and broadening its reach.

**Reservation System for Music Sets:** This allowed others to engage more easily, and the radio staff to move out of manually-managed excel sheets, aggregated from multiple sources, that they used beforehand.
