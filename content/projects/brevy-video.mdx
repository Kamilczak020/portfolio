My 4-year long adventure with Brevy started with Brevy Video - a chrome extension video recorder combined with a feature-heavy video-processing centered application and a polished web app experience. I began as a general senior engineer, initially through Toptal, with the task of helping to materialize the company vision as an MVP for their YCombinator seed round.

In the timespan of a month and a half, together with two other founders/engineers, we created an MVP of a tool that allowed us to raise **a $2.5M seed round at a $13M valuation** - that we later developed for the next two years.

**Chrome extension:** Developed a page-injecting chrome extension with a complex, animated, react-driven interface. The extension was responsible for leaving annotations on page elements, capturing video from screen, user camera or both, as well as displaying information relevant to the current webpage.

**Backend services:** Developed core services, responsible for supporting features of our web application like identity and authorization, customer data processing and CRUD functionality.

**Video processing service:** Working tightly with the chrome extension, developed a service that was responsible for collecting and processing video data chunks that came from the extension over WebRTC, with fallback for requesting missing or corrupted chunks over websockets. Using FFMPEG under the hood, processing was orchestrated for maximum efficiency, as time-to-deliver of the video was our main metric.

**Infrastructure:** Architected and maintained a microservice-based backend infrastructure responsible for running all our backend services. Managed automatic CI/CD with Gitlab, inter-service communications with RabbitMQ, cache layer with Redis and monitoring with Grafana and Datadog.

**Active collaboration:** To allow customers to collaborate live on documents shared within their team space, I introduced a CRDT-based Y.js resolution server, that communicated over websockets and integrated with Lexical, to provide a full, real-time collaborative experience.
